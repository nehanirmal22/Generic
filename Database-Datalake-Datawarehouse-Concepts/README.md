|Definition | A database is a storage location that houses structured data. | A data warehouse is a system that stores highly structured information from various sources. Data warehouses typically store current and historical data from one or more systems. Simply Put - "Is a data warehouse a database?" Yes, a data warehouse is a giant database that is optimized for analytics. | A data lake is a repository of data from disparate sources that is stored in its original, raw format. Like data warehouses, data lakes store large amounts of current and historical data. What sets data lakes apart is their ability to store data in a variety of formats including JSON, BSON, CSV, TSV, Avro, ORC, and Parquet. |

Auditing data entry | The goal of using a data warehouse is to combine disparate data sources in order to analyze the data, look for insights, and create business intelligence (BI) in the form of reports and dashboards. | Typically, the primary purpose of a data lake is to analyze the data to gain insights. However, organizations sometimes use data lakes simply for their cheap storage with the idea that the data may be used for analytics in the future. |
